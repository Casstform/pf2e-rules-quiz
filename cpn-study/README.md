# Perioperative Study Site

A static, independent CPN(C) practice site at
https://casstform.github.io/pf2e-rules-quiz/cpn-study/.

The current bank has 304 original multiple-choice questions based on the
user-supplied ORNAC *Guidelines for Perioperative Practice in Canada*, 17th
edition (April 2025). It covers every numbered subsection, with 60 questions
in 15 four-part cases. CNA's 2020 perioperative exam blueprint informs the
six domain weights and case proportion. No ORNAC PDF or extracted text is
published in this repository.

## Maintain the bank

Edit `ornac-questions.txt` and `case-groups.json`, then run
`python3 build-bank.py`. The pipe-delimited question fields are:

`section|domain|prompt|correct|wrong1|wrong2|wrong3|rationale`

Domains are `E` (ethical/professional), `S` (safety), `I` (infection
prevention), `P` (perioperative phases/anesthesia), `X` (exceptional events),
and `M` (resources). Each item has four distinct choices and a reference to
its ORNAC subsection. The build script checks field counts, unique prompts,
case groups, source sections, and the generated explanation fields. The site
shuffles answer choices and keeps attempts, missed status, and saved items in
browser storage under a 17th-edition key.

The source link on the site leads to ORNAC's information page. Readers need
their own access to the full guideline. Questions and learning notes are
original paraphrases, not copied guideline passages or official exam items.
This project is not endorsed by CNA or ORNAC.
